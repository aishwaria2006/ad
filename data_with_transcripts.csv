He gave me a long story because once he started to act, he stopped writing. Bob told me a story. He stopped writing, gave up the stipraider, and the hero to be a student. He told me a story once that the hero to be a student had an editorial. That Bob benchedly is giving up his typewriter. And Bob says, you know what I got mad. He said, I got about 100 letters asking for the typewriter. But he walked up to me in a party one day and he says, could you write a song for me called Two Little Words I Love You? And I wrote such a song. And we became very good friends. He was marvelous me. But he was one who chiefly encouraged me to stay with writing. And not just, you know, when I was acting, when I was performing, after a while, nightclubs, I stopped creating for a while. He got to write you. Well, what you do in nightclubs and all those, you begin to do the short things, your best things. And you don't dare try anything new. Make it hit with a highball glass. So you, and that stops you for a while. But I went back then."

She took me down to the person who had come up with this idea of having a petition and she walked right in and into the kitchen. And she said to him, what made you decide that you should have us not living in this neighborhood? Who are you to make that decision? So part of that I learned very quickly that if you've got an issue, you better start speaking up very early. What was nice about the end of it was the principal at the school called all of the people together and told them that if they tried to get us out of the neighborhood, he would make sure that we could go into his house and we could still stay there."

The teacher looks down at me and then he says, if you are not prepared to do all of the work that we're talking about, I would suggest that you leave now and sign up for home economics. And I look around and for the first time I discover on the only girl in the room. I would not move. Because I knew my mother would not never forgive me if I did. I did very well in college. And I saw an ad, it said, would you like a job that doesn't pay a lot of money, but gives lots of satisfaction to you in terms of what you're doing in the society? And I said, they're talking to me."
D:\projects\Big Projects\AD detection\dementia\Aileen Hernandez\aileenhernandez_5_2.wav,dementia," We are more conscious in this state now about the places where an equity actually exist. And we do try to pass laws and we do see some changes. I can remember, for example, when the issues around disability first came into play. And people said, this is incredible. We can't do all of these things that will cost a fortune for us to do it. And what these things were, was such things as, how do we make sure that people in wheelchairs can get up on a sidewalk? And or get into an elevator or do any of those things. And this was horrifying to people who just got to cost fortunes to carve out all these curbs so that you could get people on their wheelchairs in there. Well, what has turned out to happen is that by doing that for what was considered a small group of people, we have incredibly improved the ability of a lot of other people to use them as well. For example, any parent who has a child in the stroller is now using those carved out curbs. They would not have been able to do that before, but they found it works. So it didn't just help a small group of people. Once it was done, it opened up a lot of groups of people. I'm sure that any delivery company that has to deliver also appreciates those curbs being carved out. And we've also learned that our stereotypes begin to fall away once we have the experience with them. Because we have found that we have lost a lot of tech."
D:\projects\Big Projects\AD detection\dementia\Alan Ramsey\alanramsey_10.wav,dementia," I have no real love for the two leaders. I think that the poorest leaders I've seen, and consequently we've seen the poorest campaigns, it's worth about prejudice. It's been about not a debate about policy. It's been about prejudice, about fear, about those sorts of things, attacking one another very, very negative campaigns. But once again, by two leaders that I had no real support for, I thought the two leaders that should have been there, we're rather in turnable. And that's a genuine, that would have been a genuine choice for the voters. I mean, I think Gillard is an accident, and I think Tony Abbott got there when the Liberal Party split. He won, he got the leadership by one vote, 43, 42. God knows how it happened, but I would say that if Turnbull had been the leader, that would have been no contest, he would have absolutely given Gillard a bath in this campaign."
D:\projects\Big Projects\AD detection\dementia\Allan Burns\AllanBurns_5.wav,dementia," Chris Hayward, who was really one of Jay's top writer and who had another partner at the time and Jay and Chris created Dudley to write and he wrote a lot of the Rocky and Bow Winkle episodes and was, you know, generally pretty hilarious guy. He and I decided that we really didn't want to stay in the animation business forever. I didn't want to be writing from moves when I was 45 years old and Chris who was 10 years older than I, it's true I didn't want to do it anymore. So we began trying our hand at freelance stuff. Why we're still working for Jay and we came up with an idea to do a series about of family of sort of weird, offbeat characters that were loosely based in our minds on the Charles Adams cartoons used to be in the New York, very strange-looking husband and wife and look like Peter Laurie and the Empire. We thought that would make an interesting kind of family comedy."

Both of the polygons to me, but it's very nice lettuce, very nice. If I appreciate them, it was respond to. And flowers, not for me I hope, or why I guess. It contacted me. I was in the street listening to this thing. Transferred some of that recorded stuff onto my mobile. A lot of traffic around me, hardly here. And at the end it was a little sound very nice. And at the end it was a huge cold in me. I said it sounded a bit weird. I don't understand why it sounded a little rossal work. I didn't even know what I was in there. I said, well yeah, I know. I know, I wrote for one, it was said. I said, well no, really? He said, would you like to do the whole thing again next week if you feel free? I said that's a good idea. When you cut everything you've done. Whatever problem, I'm not so lost at all."

And instead of just smoking, which it did, it also soaked through the jacket, doing dress rehearsals when the afternoon I remember. And I said, I've got a hot run after you said, I'm sad to stop. I said, well, something's wrong. Took the jacket off, my skin was kind of plum color. All the years. However, not much pain. I had it dressed, and did the show in the evening. And that got a bit painful. So if you ever see the show again, just a little tear of sorrow there for me there. And at the same note, this is where it really hurt. It's because at the same time I was playing the lead in no sex, please wear British of this, strands here at Atlanta every night, 1975. We recorded on a Sunday. And that was very physical show. And for the next three weeks, I had to have my arms and things dressed every day. But to have, as part of the business in the show, to have these encyclopedias thrown at me like this, as a gag, into there, I don't know, it's such pain. That's not nice, but you know, you survive.

One is that he is, of course, the inheritor of a great tradition of visual arts in Japan. And perhaps somewhat more concerned than a number of other Japanese filmmakers with perpetuating that, which in a sense, making it enter into modern cinema. The other thing is that he is an extraordinary film writer and scriptwriter with a propensity for adaptations of canonical texts. One of those, for example, is the editor of TSTFC. Another is, in fact, this was, who saw that, which is a canonical text of a very particular kind in Russia. And we'll talk about that, perhaps. A bit later. Third, I think, is that there's a certain kind of mixture of extreme clarity in Kursal's work. A kind of clarity which often favors."

I don't see why there is any reason for him to be discontented in any way with what he's already produced, human beings as they are. But as it were thinking, now we can get on with the real business of converting them to some religion or punishing them for not following. The whole idea of this being, I think, well, the whole point of creating a universe is, in the case of Islam, to have the satisfaction of torturing some of its members forever. But then, as I say, I have no respect for Islam as a system of thought, after all, whereas Christianity had two things, a first-rate philosophical intellect, in some Paul, knowing all relevant languages and all the things about the ancient world and the ancient civilization and the defining instance of a charismatic figure in Jesus Christ."

I think trying to answer your question, I had never experienced the north. I didn't know anything about the north. I didn't know anything about any other society other than what we lived in. So to answer your question, truthfully, I already with me, just that some people had and some had not. And I wished I could have been one of those that had. I'd that's the truth. Well, I guess I was an average Afro-American boy or American boy, really. I used to hunt fish. Played that shit in the novel. It was never good in any of it.

Bad in a lot of cases for people you don't even know. You still feel, you know, imp in a way of speaking because you can't do anything to have them, you don't know. Well, you just, you're just there. For example, a few, one a month ago or so, I was in Europe and I read about JFK Junior. Well, I had a chance to meet him when he was a teenager. His mother brought, he ended up sister-by. We were playing Manhattan one night. The X-first lady at that time, after the president was dead, brought the kids of mine, what we were playing. So I had a chance to see him meet him. And then reading about him as wife and sister-in-law was all killed at one time. This hurt. Yeah. It would have hurt me if I didn't. If I had not met him. But I had met him."

A third of Australia's carbon emissions come from bushfires. And they said, well, that's a natural disaster. So now it's not.

They had actually been looking for an actress to play Lisa for months. They interviewed in New York, London, and LA, and couldn't find anyone. They started rehearsals without Lisa. And my mother was in Vaudeville, and an agent friend of hers, Nushie had three daughters, and said, do you have one daughter who's over 18, who looks 16 and can sing and dance and act? They wanted an actress over 18 because they didn't want her to have to go to school on the set, because the role of Lisa was larger than that of the other children, and they didn't want to lose that time every day. So I went in, I met the casting agent. There was nobody there. I couldn't get nervous, and I couldn't compare myself to anyone, because there was no one there, and I didn't know about the sound of music. I had never seen the play. I hadn't really been clamoring to be an actress. I was working and going to college and saving money to travel. And I met with the casting director, and he had me come back the next day and read the 16 going on 17 scene, which I did. And then he called me back again, and I met the director and read the scene for him. And then I had to come back the next day to sing 16 going on 17. And my mother and father both sang, it's just a genetic quality that I've inherited, our whole family sings. So I sang 16 going on 17, and then they called me back the next day, and I danced for the choreographers, and I had studied dance since the time I was four, so that was the easy part of it.

And so when I came on the first character that I introduced was a character named Sal Benadetto, who was a bad cop, who was always beaten up Charlie Hade and so on. And who seemed to me to be a more accurate representation of at least one aspect of policing. And he wanted Benadetto, want a bravina bank, and they send a robot in, he was hiding in the vault, and they send a robot in so they can watch what he's doing. And he starts beating the robot with his fists. And he's a kind of unreconstrued. He's a lotite. He hates technology, he hates all of it.

I was quite strange actually, because I mean, the first scene I did, I was doing nothing else, but carrying Alex, who was Malcolm McDowell, down the stairs. And I did all day, you know, nonstop. And at the end of the day, I could hardly move, like at the early move, arms, like, you know.

The next part of the story I heard I couldn't believe. They said that Department of Defense is bringing them back to the East Coast, but in down a Baltimore land and they're told from here. You pay your own way home and by the way, be back in two weeks, so we get you back to Iraq. I didn't believe it. I had my staff check and it was true. I filed a bill about two weeks later to require the Department of Defense to pay the domestic travel. And every time I filed a new bill, I do what's called a deer colleague letter. And within 10 days, two weeks, I had 138 Coast sponsors. We public and Zandemic Rasside on this bill. I don't really know that across the top of my deer colleague letter, Blue Pen, it's a dear Mr. President. I know you care about our troops. Please make this happen to this morning.

And I walked over to him and I said, Mr. Secretary, I'm going to ask for him in a few minutes. I'll make sure my pocket hanging in the slender. And he said, what is this? I told him he said, I said, I would really appreciate it. If you could help me get this done for our troops, he said, let me see what I can do. I'll get back with you. He never called me back. Never wrote me back. But two weeks after I talked to him, he incorporated my bill into the Defense Department. The budget retroactive September 11,01, just like I'd written. And it's now all. And that really felt good. And I had two, in fact, back home, two members of the army come up to me and thank me for doing the bill. And I said, you know, I didn't even come back from Iraq because I never didn't have the money to get home. This was before my very big."

And under the last administration, about $380 billion had already been spent. So what we're trying to do here now is to make sure that the rest of this money is spent in appropriate ways. We've already set up the special inspector general establishing that piece of responsibility here.

Well, you've compared him to other leaders of other democracies. And let's just, let's figure out how much democracy we actually had going on in the country at the time. Because remember, Canada is a country of three and a half million people at the time. Basically, one city. And it's not the city we're in now. John was 60,000 people. John was quite small. How much democracy do we have in Canada at the time? At the time, well, actually, only about 20% of people had the vote. No women to start with. No native people, no average of those.

But I do feel very strongly about the fact that great men have been disenfranchised for a long time and have not been able to sit in high places politically or in other levels because of color. But this is had great psychological ramifications, not only for the Negro community who has had many reversals over the last couple of years because the racism which permeates American life from top to bottom and various subtle ways and very aggressive obvious ways. The Negro has paid a terrible price for this. But somehow you will find that racism in its subtlest and its most evil sense has worked its way deep into the fiber of the hearts and minds of many men and women. And with this going on, it has had its incredible influence on my own life. I was born in the ghetto. My mother was a domestic worker. My father was a semen. I grew up in Harlem. I grew up not only with the racism and segregation in America but I grew up in the West Indies, on the colonialism. And my aunts and uncles and my grandparents were agricotolists. They were farmers.

It gave us opportunity to give people who have been frustrated and the ability to express their concerns about what go on in South Africa. We gave them a platform. The 60 stations around the world to carry this broadcast, the 72 to 80,000 people to have been in remote stadium today, for tens of millions of people to have viewed this event.

And it ended negotiations with Iran during what was a terrible war between Iran and the Iraq where what a million people were killed. And at the meantime, they were violating strict prohibitions against what they were doing in Central America. Now, that's pretty serious stuff. And frankly, it's one of the reasons I ran for the presidency, because I didn't have any intention. I'd never thought of running for the presidency until the Iran contract scandal hit. And then I kind of looked at this and I said, I can't believe this. And I saw this, I've got to go ahead and see if we can change this. So he knew what was going on. I think there was any question about it."

But there was about all of that, the sense that perhaps none of it was true. He was ripping them off. It was travelers tales. But of course, that was also a reaction to that particular kind of room. Now this year we have a very different room. We have a room which is alive, very youthful and very, very passionate, very volatile room. And so I need to respond to that in a different way.

We had lunch, which was very nice, and the two of them got up at the end of the lunch. And I thought they were going to make coffee or something. And all of a sudden I was grabbed from behind by George, this big powerful man. And I thought he was playing some kind of game. So I was laughing at joking. And then his wife appeared in front of me with a pair of scissors. And I knew in an instant what she was going to do and I began to scream and shout, and now it was serious. I was fighting.

Now, when I first day off came, where did we head? I was! Of course, we wanted to get some excitement, feel, and buzz of being in the middle of the film capital of the world. And we found that, you just recall, Grammons, Chinese theatre, it's our, the Chinese theatre, and we looked at these slabs of concrete with footprints and handprints and incredibly famous signatures signed in them. And with me, it was a colleague, another actor from the company playing small supporting roles, a guy called Ben Kingsley. And then we started looking at this stuff going, wow, what must it be like? It must be amazing. Well, there I was, getting to do it myself. And Hollywood is American movies always had a huge influence on me. I saw them when I was young, and they, well, my childhood wasn't bright. So, movies were an escape. As acting, for me, for a long time, became an escape, I didn't have to be Patrick Stewart anymore.

And fortunately, and part of the ceiling they had loosened up. So it flipped around my legs. Otherwise you would have cut my legs. And I think that was such a terrifying experience. And nothing happened, of course. I was saved or whatever you want to call it. I didn't lose my legs. But it was such a gruesome idea that it nearly happened. That it obsessed my whole life.

But I mean, they do that and all that has to do with, let's say, making more money. Because then the movie is not an R and the PG, the R team everybody can go in and it's certainly to do with certain this generation of the capitalist system. We might go too far there.

From 1954 to 1955, no effort was made by a South Vietnamese in relation to the Geneva Accords to engage any effort toward the elections that were to be held in July of 1956. In October of 1955, a referendum was held in South Vietnam, between Moud Die and Goad Dins' The M. Although it is rather probable that Goad Dins' The M would have won that referendum. The entire election was manipulated completely and totally by Goad Dins' new, his brother. So we had a incredible figure of 98.6 of the vote turnout at that time. From that point on, up to July 1956, when the elections were not held, no effort was ever made in relation to the provisions of the Geneva Accords in 1954. And as a result, with our help, our pressure, our support, military, and economic, we failed to allow the people of Vietnam for the second time since the end of the Second World War to have a democratic election. Therefore, I think that it is in moral, because I don't believe that we can stop the spread of communism by sacrificing the principles of democracy, which is indeed what we did do in Vietnam in 1956 when we stopped the elections."

And then the first break I had, which kind of essentially was Bert Langcast, who came to see me in a play in Los Angeles. And after that he signed me to a contract on fortune and I was drafted. I was going to appear and I wanted his sweet, sweet canylose success. I was going to be in that movie. But I got to."

And when we were also pretending to be interested in the Rants Ferman Getty and Alan Ginsberg and talking about smoking dope but not doing it in those days in the early 60s. And that was all sort of mixed in with, I mean, I remember when Sid went out and bought a future Rometri, you know, red sort of plastic guitar whereas before that people who being biddling around with acoustic guitars and music was about C&D. It was much more woody-gathery than the shadows but then, you know, walked on run and Apache in, those things and they skid started to sit, I remember particularly, you know, it would land to play Apache.

Although I'm just told you there for a minute, I think. It's a question of a power in use paper for writers can be greatly overdone. We have certain, but we can, we have more responsibility than the power I think. The newspaper can create very controversial, is a stir up argument with the community discussion, a control light on in justices. Just as a connid the opposite, can hide things and be a great paper evil. It's not a perfect system obviously, but can you think of a better way? I think the important thing is that the big plenty of newspapers, the plenty of different people control in them, so that there's a variety of view point. This is a choice for the public. This is the freedom of the president, the freedom of president mustn't be one side, I just for a public citizen. The speakers, he plays us. Trying, bully the community, it must be an alternative. It's along with the rural alternatives that I think of the public's framework protected. Certainly better protected than that be if the whole thing was run by a government-minister"

It Britain was a little different, although they were in it early. The BBC was so omnipresent, control in the very thing. Newspapers were slow to move on television. But it was the common sense in the news. Now of course, first of us to say ourselves, then as we go into it, it would create more choice, more variety. We have a lot of cable channels here that go to 100 million homes. And some with very big powerful audiences, like Fox News, and others like I made broadcasting network, which goes out to the whole 110 million homes. That doesn't do much news, but that's entertaining. The idea that is when we start with it, we thought, look, there's room for more choice than just like three networks. Now of course, the problem is the average home gets 80 to 100 channels, some more, they pay extra. So the audience is being fragmented. So it's become, some is quite a difficult business. It's just for cable, and you can charge the cable companies for carrying it. For every home they go to. It's a very good business."
D:\projects\Big Projects\AD detection\nodementia\Stan Lee\Stan Lee_1.wav,nodementia," and petaders listening, but basically, I guess, you have to, the big thing is the readers of our comic books and we specialize in superhero fantasy stories. They love to be surprised, and this is really the most difficult thing when you grind out so many stories, but each story has to have an element of something new and something unexpected, you know? And our formula basically is to mix fantasy with realism. In other words, we'll take a character who's got superhuman power. Let's say he can fly through the air or like Spider-Man, he can climb on walls. We take him and we say, suppose there were such a character, and he really existed in the real world. What problems would he have? What would he do with face with a certain situation? I say, if I had superhuman powers, which is not for a moment to concede that I don't. What would my intense be? And what, for instance, wouldn't I still have to worry about dandruff or about athlete's foot, or making a living, or having my dates like me, and so forth? So we take these bigger than life characters, and we give them very life-like qualities and problems. And that had never been done in comics before. You see, the heroes had always been just sort of cardboard characters, who were always good, virtuous, noble, never worried about money, never had any problems. I think just,"
D:\projects\Big Projects\AD detection\nodementia\Stan Lee\Stan Lee_2.wav,nodementia," Well, they were perfect in the sense of the characters they were portraying, but we tried to bring comics a little more into the real world. I shouldn't really say this, but the chances are that possibly even you and I are in perfect. I wouldn't say that about Marina. Marina, I know she is, but today most people just aren't. We tried to make our characters have feet of clay, a poor spider-man. I mean, okay, he's pretty good at catching bad guys, but he's apt to get an allergy attack while he's fighting. He worries about Dendruff. He'll have an in-grown toenail, tears his costume. His aunt may want, let him go out to save the world because he's not wearing his collarschers and it's snowing out. The funny thing is, I started doing that as a gag and really to keep myself awake, you know. And I found that the readers are as crazy as I am. They started enjoying this sort of thing. So after 20 years of writing, pap, and writing things like the strips you mentioned before, I suddenly realized, gee, I can actually have fun with what I'm doing. And now, the more realistic we make our characters, the more the college kids who read them think that it's satire, which has taught me a very great lesson. The world is so crazy that if you present things the way they really are, it comes across as broad satire."

I got down to Spider-Man, spider-man. It just sounded dramatic. So okay, I had my hero. I had his power as name. And then I figured just for fun, I'm going to give him personal problems, because except for you people who are perfect, that your life's perfect. But most other people have personal problems. And then I thought I'd make a meetingager, because there were no teenage superheroes that I knew of at the time. So armed with all that wonderful material, those great ideas I ran into my publishers office and I told them, this was my reaction. The reaction he gave me. Stan, that is the worst idea I ever heard. First of all, and he started to give me his very logical, man, very intellectual. First of all, people hate spiders. So you can't call a hero's spider-man. You want him to be a teenager.

D:\projects\Big Projects\AD detection\nodementia\Terry Riley\TerryRiley_2.wav,nodementia," Jim Newman, who had the Deluxe egalery in those days, had this idea to create a bunch of video works using an cooperation with KQED. He asked a bunch of different artists to produce half-hour shows including people like Walter D. Maria, also, did some of these programs. So at the time I was just thinking of coming back to California, moving back to California, I came out and contacted Arloactin, who was a sculptor who I'd known years before. And Arlo had been making these highly polished, spherical balls made of titanium when he was getting from NASA. And he was swinging them from pendulum and from the ceiling. And we had this idea to build loudspeakers, also out of spheres, and to surround the audience with these kind of swinging spheres. So when Jim Newman came to me with this idea about the video, I thought this would be a natural place to incorporate this whole idea of swinging speakers that highly polished titanium spheres, and then I would play music live through it at the same time. So we went into a studio down at KQED and did the concert part of it."
D:\projects\Big Projects\AD detection\nodementia\Terry Riley\TerryRiley_3.wav,nodementia," What's important today is make a lot of money on a lot of objects. I saw this happening around the 1980s I was teaching at Noes College in California teaching music classes and students who before who were dropping out of school and you know just experimenting with drugs, experimenting with music with different life-sales started coming back to college and taking business classes. So it was an interesting time to go from this thing of wearing suits, then going into long hair, wearing relaxed clothing, living together in communities, to going back to college, to get a business degree, to make more money, to get more things. And we haven't actually been able to leave that. I think there are other influences that happen in this great universe that make these cycles go from one world we had in the 60s to kind of where we have today. So I'm sure that we'll come out of this and I'm hoping that there'll be an age of enlightenment that will come because we have the possibilities with technology to even improve our knowledge and improve. But we always have to keep this part."

It's the what they earn on equity or net worth. But assets are the earning factors. And they've changed the rules so that you have to have more net worth per dollar of assets. And obviously, if you have more net worth per dollar of assets, and you're earning a constant amount on assets, your earnings on net worth go down. Now, they were ungodly profitable. The better ones were back 15 years ago or 10 years ago, even when they had high ratios of assets to net worth. And some of them even cheered in terms of having even more assets than the regulators would have allowed. And you had these sips, as they were called, city group had a whole bunch of them. So they were off balance sheet ways of even controlling more assets. But all of that sort of thing has been terminated. And now they've got much lower limits as to the assets to net worth ratios. And the bigger the bank, the some extent, the bigger the bank, the lower that ratio can be. So what was a very profitable business? Has been turned into a good business if executed. Well, it's a pretty simple business. I mean, if you get your money cheap, very cheap, Wells Fargo will have a trillion dollars roughly across to that of depositors money.
